This sub-project of Cinquain consists of two components that can be utilized in wider application:

1. Implementation of the Karp-Rabin/Rabin fingerprint algorithm tailored for a sliding window

Detailed description and source code can be found under /fingerprint directory. Theoretical aspects of the algorithm are demonstrated in [1, 2].

2. Implementation of a linear-time and constant-space delta-encoding algorithm for large files

Detailed description and source code can be found under /delta directory. Theoretical aspects of the algorithm are demonstrated in [3].

All programs are written in the C++ language and aim at high efficiency.
